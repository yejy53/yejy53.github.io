Greetings! I'm currently a Master student at **Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU)**, advised by Prof. [Weijia Li](https://liweijia.github.io/). 

I received my B.E. degree from Sun Yat-sen University in 2024. Currently, I am also serving as a research intern at **Shanghai AI Lab**, mentored by [Conghui He](https://lke.cloud.tencent.com/lke#/link-info/redirect?target=https://conghui.github.io/).

My research goal is to conduct influential scientific research in **Computer Vision** and **AI Image Generation**.
